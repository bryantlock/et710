  <h>Apple iPhone 7 Review </h>

  <p>

  I donâ€™t really know much about the apple product release except for the new ear-phone and camera changes. I think the new wireless ear-phones would allow people to avoid tangled earphones, it questions me if we are able to use this new upgrade from the latest IPhone to previous IPhones.

  I also think that the new splash and water resistant upgrade is an enormous game changer for certain people who may use IPhones for a certain profession, job or accidental slips into water. The new upgrades have created a huge distance between the new and the previous Iphone and I think that these upgrades are of better use with businesses and in general people with tight schedules on a daily basis.
